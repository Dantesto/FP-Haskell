Arithmetic parser that is capable of calculating values of expressions.

To start the program, call the "calculator" function, which works interactively and ends when you type "q" instead of expression.

Features of the parser:
* binary operators +, -, *, /, ^;
* unary operators +, -;
* parentheses;
* functions cos, sin, ln;
* constants pi, e;
* variable x, whose value must be set separately;
* ignores whitespaces;
* error handling.

Easy to add the following features:
* since the parser calculates as 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3), binary operators that execute "right-to-left" and symmetric operators;
* any unary operators;
* functions of one (and several too) variable;
* any constants;
* support of more than one variable.
